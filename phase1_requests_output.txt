Run this python script and record outputs:
    import requests
    r = requests.get("http://scanme.nmap.org", timeout=5)
    print("Status:", r.status_code)
    print("Final URL:", r.url)
    print("Server header:", r.headers.get("Server"))
    print("Content-Type:", r.headers.get("Content-Type"))
    print("First 200 chars of body:\\n", r.text[:200].replace('\n','\\n'))

Outputs:

Status: 200
Final URL: http://scanme.nmap.org/
Server header: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
Content-Type: text/html
First 200 chars of body:\n <!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Go ahead and ScanMe!</title>\n<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">\n<meta name="theme-color" content="#2A0D45">\n<link rel="p

What to look for:

    Compare the Status and Final URL with the curl results. requests follows redirects by default; curl -I does not unless you use -L.
    The Server header in Python should match the curl output; mismatches indicate different server behavior depending on client.
    The start of the body helps confirm the page content and encoding.

Questions to answer in phase1_notes.txt:

    Did requests and curl report the same status and server header?
        For status it just showed 200 when I ran the request file, where as curl shows HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
        For header, it was the same and showed Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)

    If different, what header or other factor might explain it (redirects, default headers, user agent)?
        Headers are basically similar, just return different snippits of the same information depending on protocols.

Run this in terminal:   curl -i  -A "MyTestAgent/1.0" https://httpbin.org/headers
                        curl -i  https://httpbin.org/headers

What to look for:

    Some servers change behavior based on the User-Agent. They may block, redirect, or return different content-lengths.
    Web application firewalls or simple server rules sometimes detect known scanning agents and respond differently.
