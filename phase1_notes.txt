Paste into terminal: curl -I http://scanme.nmap.org

Questions to answer in phase1_notes.txt:

    What status line did you get and what does it mean?
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK So the connection is ok and request succeeded.

    What is the Server header value? Is it specific (nginx/1.22) or generic?
        Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)

Paste into terminal:
    curl http://scanme.nmap.org-o scanme.html
    head -n 40 scanme.html

Questions to answer in phase1_notes.txt:

    What is the <title> of the page (if present)?
        Go ahead and ScanMe!

    Do you see any <form> elements? What are their action attributes (copy them)?
    Not with the exact code:
    But when I ran this: curl -i http://scanme.nmap.org
    I got:
        <form class="nst-search" id="nst-foot-search" action="/search/"> Action atribute is search.

Part 3:
Questions to answer in phase1_notes.txt:

    Did requests and curl report the same status and server header?
        For status it just showed 200 when I ran the request file, where as curl shows HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
        For header, it was the same and showed Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)

    If different, what header or other factor might explain it (redirects, default headers, user agent)?
        Headers are basically similar, just return different snippits of the same information depending on protocols.

Part 4:
Questions to answer in phase1_notes.txt:

    Did the response change (status, server header, content-length) when the User-Agent was MyTestAgent/1.0?
        The server changed, the titles all showed error code 503: Service Temporarily Unavailable.

    If it had changed, what could that mean about the server’s defenses?
        It was an irregular request that they have set up to block or deny.

Step 5 — Short synthesis

Open phase1_notes.txt and append a 4–6 line summary answering:

    What three pieces of information from the steps above would be most useful in a reconnaissance report, and why?
        1) Deferent outputs or things available through different user-agents. Some pages would becoe blocked.
        2) You can see the exect server used through the server header, so you could plan exploits based off this.
        3) What version of HTTP is used.

    One quick defensive suggestion an admin could use to reduce information leakage from headers.
        Hide server headers and http version if possible.
