Oversations:


Which server headers you observed — were they helpful?
    We could see the status code for each bheader, the server, the content type, website url and the content lenght. This helps get an idea of how it responded to your request, whether you got access or were redirected and what server it is on.

Differences between the target sites in headers, titles, forms, and keywords.
    Depending on your user agent, you may get different responses. 

One defensive use of this information:
    You can get an idea of how a server responds to a request, and gather information about it and how it responds to different user agents.


Ethical precautions you must follow when performing similar reconnaissance:
    Must have explicite permissions from the websites.
